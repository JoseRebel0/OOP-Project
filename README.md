# 🧵 Clothing Store Management System — Phase 1

## 📌 Overview  
This project represents the first development phase of a clothing store management system built in **C#**.  
The goal of this stage is to establish the foundation of the system through the creation of the essential classes and relationships required to manage products and customers.

## 🏗️ Key Features (Phase 1)

### ✔️ **Class Structure**
- Implementation of classes representing:
  - **Products** (including different types of shirts using inheritance)
  - **Customers**
- Each class encapsulates relevant attributes and behaviors, following object-oriented principles.

### ✔️ **Inheritance**
- A base **Shirt** class defines the common attributes shared by all shirt types.
- Specialized shirt types extend this base class, adding unique properties.

### ✔️ **Object Creation Tests**
- All classes were tested to ensure:
  - Correct instantiation of objects  
  - Proper functioning of constructors  
  - Accurate initialization of attributes

## 🎯 Objectives of Phase 1
- Apply **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts such as classes, encapsulation, and inheritance.  
- Build a solid structure to support future phases (stock management, sales processing, file persistence, etc.).  
- Ensure each component works individually before expanding the system.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C#**
- **Visual Studio**
- **GitHub** for version control
